# NixOS_Config


#### This is configuration file for my nixos system , with hyprland , I plan to switch to this system as my main , when I have moved my configs in home-manager!!

#### Motives for using NixOS
1. End game of linux (in my opinion)
2. version control
3. Reproducibility of the system


### TODO
- [ ] Add home manager config
- [ ] Add flakes for system
